I stayed one night at an inn in the city, then set out for the Hollow Rite Cave early the next morning. Yesterday, I had arrived quickly because I went to the mountain by carriage, but it took a long time on foot. I showed my admission certificate to the gatekeeper, entered, and headed for the Outer Wall Quarters that Yimin had told me about. 

A part of the wall built around the Martial Sect was broken, and beyond it was a slope. As I descended the slope, I saw an old building standing on the edge of a cliff. This was undoubtedly the Outer Wall Quarters. I looked at the wall behind it and understood why it was called that. As I approached the old building, a man of about thirty came out. The man turned his eyes toward me.

"I haven't seen you before. Are you a new outer disciple?"

"Yes. I look forward to working with you starting today."

The man looked me over as if sizing me up.

"What's your name?"

"I'm Den Kou."

"I'm Fan Inje. If there's anything you don't understand, just ask."

"Thank you. Which room should I use?"

"The first floor on the left side is empty. You can use any of those."

I thanked him and went inside. There were small, dormitory-like rooms lined up, and when I went to the left side, there were several rooms with no names written on the doors. I chose a room near the entrance and went in. It was about five tatami mats in size and had only a bedstead. I sensed a presence behind me and turned around to see Inje standing there.

"The straw mats are in the storeroom, so please use one of those."

It was said that the inner disciples were provided with proper futons, but the outer disciples used straw mats. A straw mat is a woven mat made of straw or similar materials. I brought a mat from the storeroom, spread it on the bedstead, and tried lying down. 

As I thought, it was prickly I hate straw mats. It would be getting cold soon, so I decided to get something else. It seemed meals were available in the dining hall. And since they were free, I didn't have to worry about food expenses.

However, the food was said to not be very delicious. The main ingredients were apparently potatoes and the meat of animals hunted in the forests of the Demonic Domain. As for the food, many things were similar to what I had eaten in my previous life. Wheat, rice, soybeans, buckwheat, and various vegetables were almost the same. 

The common people's cuisine was mostly simple, with plain flavors. Even so, as I was no gourmet, I had no complaints. But sometimes, I would get an intense craving for curry or ramen. Oh well, in a wide world, there might be similar dishes, so I'll look for them. I remembered something I wanted to ask.

"What are the chores assigned to outer disciples?"

"Basically, it's drawing water and sweeping. Kou, you'll be drawing water. You'll draw water in the morning, and you'll be free from the afternoon. Is there anything you want to learn?"

"Aren't the inner disciples supposed to teach us?"

Inje shrugged.

"There are inner disciples who instruct, but basically, you learn on your own. The books for that are in the library on the second floor. However, the librarian manages them, so you'll need to get permission to look at them. And taking them out of the library is forbidden."

The books in the library were said to be expensive. I asked Inje to guide me to the library.

"This is the library."

We went up to the second floor, and when he opened a door near the center, I saw a room of about twenty _jō_. Along the walls were numerous bookshelves, filled with a great number of books and scrolls. To me, it was a mountain of treasure.

"Let me introduce you. This is the librarian, Jin Shatan. This is Kou, a new outer disciple."

"It's a pleasure to meet you."

"Feel free to ask me anything about the books and scrolls in the library."

"Can I read any of the books here?"

"Unfortunately, there are restrictions based on your Qi Refining Stage level. Also, some are written in Immortal Secret Characters, so I doubt you'll be able to read them. What's your qi level, Kou?"

"The fifth level."

Hearing this, Inje and Shatan exchanged glances.

"Really, the fifth level?"

"Shall I show you?"

![Illustration](https://i.redd.it/iwo0dov0q4jf1.jpg)  

I began to refine my qi, raising it to the fifth level. As the qi began to leak out from my body, it seemed both Inje and Shatan could tell.

"Whoa, it really is the fifth level," Inje said, surprised.

I didn't understand why he was so surprised. Even as an outer disciple, I was a Taoist, so the fifth level should be nothing more than a passing point.

"Why are you so surprised?"

"Many outer disciples quit being Taoists without ever reaching the third level."

"But there have been some who became inner disciples, haven't there?"

The two of them made sour faces.

"It's not that there haven't been any, but most of them gave up and left the Hollow Rite Cave," Inje said with a bitter expression.

"Is it that difficult to become an inner disciple?"

Hearing this, Shatan nodded with a grim face.

"In the inner disciple exam, you can pass if your qi level is at the third level, but to become an inner disciple from an outer disciple, you need to reach the eighth level."

"I don't get it. The difference between the third and eighth levels is too great."

It seemed the higher-ups in the Martial Sect weren't serious about training outer disciples. They might have created the outer disciple system simply because they wanted a labor force.

"Is that the only condition to become an inner disciple?"

"No, you can become an inner disciple if you can read the Immortal Secret Characters and defeat a Thunder Bear."

I felt it was too strict. As a detective in my previous life, it reminded me of the difference between career and non-career officers. Career officers were bureaucrats who passed the national civil service exam and entered the National Police Agency their promotions and salaries were different from non-career officers who joined the police as local civil servants. 

Just as a non-career officer could never become the Superintendent General, no matter how hard they worked, it was likely that those who started as outer disciples couldn't rise to the top in this Martial Sect. But I didn't want to get promoted within the sect. I wanted to become strong. For that, becoming an inner disciple and receiving direct instruction from the elders would be the shortcut. I wanted to become an inner disciple, somehow.

When I checked with Shatan to see which books I could read, he said I could read the books on the six bookshelves from the left. There were seven bookshelves in total, so only the seventh was forbidden. I decided to start investigating the library's books tomorrow.

When I woke up in the morning, it was time to draw water. The outer disciples worked together to draw spring water and fill the large water jars set up in nine locations. The method was manual labor: scooping spring water into buckets, carrying them on our shoulders, and pouring the water into the jars. 

It was said to be a form of cultivation to increase muscle strength using qi, but I had my doubts. At breakfast time, we would take a break to eat, then continue drawing water, and it seemed to finish around noon. Lunch was not served in the dining hall. Instead, it seemed there was no problem with cooking for ourselves.

I skipped lunch and went to the library, starting my investigation with the leftmost bookshelf. Most of the books were about the foundational knowledge of the immortal path. If I had read these first, I would have gotten a perfect score on the exam. Of course, I couldn't finish investigating in one day; it took several. The second shelf had many books on the basics of qi. 

The third shelf had history books, and the fourth and fifth shelves had many martial arts books. However, the martial arts books were varied, from unarmed combat to weapons like swords, spears, and axes, and there were so many that I was at a loss as to which to choose. And finally, on the sixth shelf, were scrolls written in Immortal Secret Characters. It seemed the senior disciples here would choose one scroll from among these, decipher the Immortal Secret Characters, and master the martial arts or qi cultivation methods within. I too began to examine the scrolls one by one, choosing the martial art and qi cultivation method that was most suitable for me.

"Hmm? This is..."

I picked up a scroll from the bottom shelf of the sixth bookshelf. On the scroll was written, _'Twilight and Dawn Art: Middle Transmission.'_ I took it to the librarian, Shatan, and got permission to read it. I spread the scroll on the table in the center of the room and began to read. However, since it was written in Immortal Secret Characters, I had to decipher it while looking it up in the Immortal Secret Character dictionary I had memorized. It was faster than using a thick dictionary, but it still took time.

The _'Twilight and Dawn Art: Middle Transmission'_ described the qi cultivation methods from the sixth to the tenth levels. However, it seemed that to reach the sixth level and beyond, the help of an immortal pill was necessary. 

An immortal pill was a spirit medicine or elixir made from various ingredients like medicinal herbs and spirit grasses. The _'Twilight and Dawn Art: Middle Transmission'_ described how to make the necessary elixir, and it seemed to be called the 'Qi Vigor Pill'. The problem was that the ingredients for the Qi Vigor Pill could only be collected in the Demonic Domain. I might be able to purchase them, but they would probably be too expensive for me to buy.

"I guess I have to go collect the medicinal herbs myself. But it's the Demonic Domain."

In the Demonic Domain, besides dangerous wild animals like bears, wolves, and tigers, there were also demonic beasts. Demonic beasts were so strong that even the weakest, the Fanged Rabbit, could easily kill a human. The **Twilight Flash Swordsmanship** alone was not enough to feel secure. The Twilight Flash Swordsmanship was a powerful martial art, but it was more for fighting people. To defeat a demonic beast with this sword style, I would probably need a special sword, one called a famous sword or a treasure sword. 

...Sigh, I can't afford one. For now, I'll engrave the _'Twilight and Dawn Art: Middle Transmission'_ into my mind with my perfect instantaneous recall. Shatan, who had been watching me, approached.

"Kou, can you read Immortal Secret Characters?"

I shook my head in denial.

"I only know a few characters."

"Is that so? You were looking at the text written in Immortal Secret Characters without using a dictionary, so I thought you could read it."

"It seems to be a book about a qi cultivation method, but is there no first transmission for this?"

"_'Twilight and Dawn Art: Middle Transmission,'_ huh? This one ended up here because the first transmission was lost. The inner disciples must have messed something up. It's a shame."

Because the first transmission was missing, it had become difficult to learn. The text used phrases like 'as written in the first transmission' or 'in the same way as the third level,' making those parts incomprehensible.

"Is there no final transmission?"

"The final transmission seems to still be in the main hall's library."

The main hall was the building where the inner disciples trained, and it housed a library and an apothecary. Incidentally, outer disciples were not allowed to enter the main hall's library.

About ten days after I started living at the Hollow Rite Cave, inner disciples paid a rare visit to the Outer Wall Barracks. They were Nii Rikyō and Fei Kanrō, men in their late twenties. The two of them gathered the outer disciples.

"We are relaying instructions from Elder Tsuin. Recently, there has been a shortage of All-Purpose Wound Salve. Outer disciples are to go to the Demonic Domain and collect Shishirua Grass."

The outer disciples began to murmur amongst themselves. Among them were Kuan Zeng, who had passed the exam with me, and another successful candidate, a girl named Mo Ashin. Zeng and Ashin came over to my side.

"Does this happen often?" Zeng asked me, as I had arrived before him.

"No, this is the first time. I don't think it's that frequent."

Ashin asked in a low voice, "Do you know what Shishirua Grass is?"

I had thought it would be necessary for earning pocket money, so I had memorized the medicinal herbs that were valuable. Shishirua Grass was a medicinal herb that resembled a dandelion, and in this season, it would be blooming with yellow flowers. Its medicinal properties were in the root, so it was collected root and all. I explained this to the two of them.

"Want to go together?" Zeng suggested. It seemed he wasn't confident just from hearing the description.

When I nodded, Ashin also said she would go with us.

"Shouldn't you go with the senior female disciples?" I asked.

Ashin shook her head. "I haven't gotten close to any of the senior disciples yet."

Since Zeng and Ashin had just arrived at the Outer Wall Quarters, they often asked me questions. I thought it was strange since I was younger, but I was probably easier to talk to than the senior disciples. We went to the armory to borrow weapons. As before, I borrowed a one-handed sword and we headed for the Demonic Domain.

"Aren't you going to get your own weapon?" Ashin asked.

"I plan to buy one eventually, but I don't have the money right now."

Ashin said her parents had bought her a combat staff. At the end of its sixty-centimeter handle were numerous steel spikes. It was a vicious-looking weapon. The fact that the small and cute Ashin was holding it so happily was a bit off-putting. 

Zeng was tall and had a well-trained body; his parents were said to be martial artists. He had learned the sword, spear, and staff, and among them, he was said to be best with the spear. Today, he had a spear he had brought from home.

"What's the name of your sword style, Kou?"

"Twilight Flash Swordsmanship. What about the one you're learning, Zeng?"

"My spear technique is called 'Long Star Spear Technique.' It's a martial art that's been passed down in my family for a long time."

Zeng seemed to be confident in his martial arts. We followed a mountain path on the mountainside of Hollow Rite Mountain and came out on the other side. From there, we descended the mountain and reached the outer edge of the Demonic Domain. 

The Shishirua Grass was supposed to be in this outer area. The three of us headed west along the edge. We made sure not to go deep into the Demonic Domain. As long as we stuck to that, we had heard from the senior disciples that we wouldn't encounter any strong demonic beasts.

"Isn't that it?"

I found a plant that looked like a dandelion and approached it. When I turned over a leaf, there was a characteristic white vein. The presence of this vein meant it was Shishirua Grass.

"So this is Shishirua Grass. Let's gather a bunch!" Zeng's voice was full of energy after seeing the real thing.

From then on, we found Shishirua Grass one after another, digging them up by the roots and collecting them. We put the collected grass into our back-sacks. They were similar to backpacks but were simple things made of cloth and string. When we had gathered about half our target, I sensed something approaching from ahead. I drew my sword abruptly, causing Zeng and Ashin to hastily ready themselves.

"What's wrong?" Zeng called out.

"Something's coming. Be careful."

Ever since my qi level reached the third level, I had become sensitive to presences. As we watched, two large monkeys emerged from the shade of the trees. They were about 160 centimeters tall, bigger than me.

"This thing has a single horn on its forehead. It's a One-Horned Monkey," Zeng said. It seemed to be a demonic beast he knew. I had thought it was strange for a normal monkey to be so large, but it was a demonic beast.

The One-Horned Monkeys approached. By then, I had raised my qi level to the fifth level, and I was ready to fight. One of the monkeys leaped and attacked from above. Zeng met it with a spear thrust. 

At the same time, I circled around and thrust the tip of my sword into the monkey's side. The monkey deflected the spear tip with its arm, but it couldn't react to my attack. The tip of my sword sank into the One-Horned Monkey's side, injuring its lung. 

The monkey demon shrieked and tried to flee. Ashin ran in and slammed her combat staff into its head. As the One-Horned Monkey staggered, its footing unsteady, Zeng's spear delivered the finishing blow.

Seeing this, the remaining monkey howled and attacked Zeng. The One-Horned Monkey tried to tear at him with its sharp claws, but Zeng blocked it with his spear. I jumped in and slashed across the monkey's back. I felt the impact, but the monkey's muscles were tough, and the wound was shallow. 

The One-Horned Monkey turned and swiped its claws at me. At that moment, Ashin slammed her combat staff into the back of its head. This was my chance. I slashed the monkey's neck with my sword.

"Phew, we managed to take them down."

As I muttered that, Zeng was looking down at the fallen One-Horned Monkeys.

"The meat from these things tastes awful."

"Really?"

"Yeah, it's tough whether you boil it or grill it."

I stroked the fur of the One-Horned Monkey. It was softer to the touch than I had expected. And it seemed warm.

"Let's skin this thing."

"Huh? What are you going to do with the skin?" Zeng seemed not to get it.

"It's going to get cold soon, so I thought I'd lay it on my bedstead instead of a futon."

Zeng and Ashin nodded in admiration. After that, we painstakingly skinned the One-Horned Monkeys. To turn this into a proper fur, we would need to ask a professional craftsman.

"We'll need about three of them to make a proper rug," Zeng said.

Hearing this, Ashin nodded. "In that case, we'll need nine for the three of us."

It seemed Ashin wanted a fur rug too. The Shishirua Grass collection was likely to continue for a few days, so we could probably gather enough for nine in that time. The grass collection continued for four days. During that time, we killed twelve One-Horned Monkeys and had a leather craftsman process their hides into fur rugs. I asked the craftsman to make four rugs, which made Zeng tilt his head.

"Isn't it three?"

"We'll sell the extra one to pay the craftsman."

Hearing this, Zeng and Ashin laughed.

"Kou, you're so reliable. I can't believe you're only ten."

It took a little time, but the finished fur rugs were sewn together to form rectangles. The texture was satisfactory, dozens of times better than the straw mats. And selling the extra one brought in a considerable income. Even though they were said to be weak, they were still the pelts of demonic beasts, so they fetched a high price for their durability. We used that income to pay the craftsman for his work.

"Couldn't this be a good source of income?" Ashin said, and Zeng nodded.

The three of them discussed it and decided to continue hunting One-Horned Monkeys.

"But why don't the senior disciples hunt One-Horned Monkeys?" Zeng seemed to wonder, as it appeared Inje and the others didn't.

"Come to think of it, bear and tiger rugs are famous, but I've never heard of a monkey rug," I said, and Ashin nodded.

"Normal monkeys are small, so you'd have to gather a lot to make a rug. It takes a lot of work to sew small pelts together to make a rug. Maybe that's why monkey rugs aren't made."

Perhaps no one had paid attention to the fact that the demonic One-Horned Monkeys were exceptionally large. Oh well. More importantly, winter was approaching, so I also wanted something to use as a blanket.
