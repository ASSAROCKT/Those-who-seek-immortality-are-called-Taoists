A year has passed since I came to the Chian Trading Company. I am now ten years old, and Yulong is thirteen. In that time, my cultivation has progressed, I can now use the **Flash Step** of the **Twilight Flash Swordsmanship**, and my qi level has reached the fifth level. The fourth and fifth levels are an enhancement of the third, by using the qi of the fifth level to strengthen my muscles, I can now produce about three times my normal power.

Yulong's qi level has finally reached the third level, and it seems he will take the entrance exam for a Martial Sect this year. Hearing this, I wanted to enter as well. However, I lack the foundational knowledge of the immortal path. Yulong probably has texts on the subject, but there's no way he would show them to me. I likely won't be able to enter a Martial Sect unless I can overcome that hurdle.

It seems that those who aim to become divine immortals usually enter one of the several Martial Sects. The one Yulong is taking the exam for is called the **Hollow Rite Cave**. Incidentally, it is said that the groups of Taoists who aim to become divine immortals, the Martial Sects, often name themselves 'XX Cave'. It seems that in the old days, they really did live and train in caves, which is why they were named as such. Even now, many Martial Sects have 'Cave' in their names, though they live in splendid mansions. And there was another characteristic of the places where Martial Sects were located: they were adjacent to a place called a **Demonic Domain**.

A Demonic Domain is a term for a forest or other area where demonic beasts live, and it was a dangerous place. It was a kind of 'power spot', like in my original world, where some kind of energy from the planet was said to well up from the ley lines. The Taoists called this 'star qi'. These were things I had heard from the priest in my hometown. However, the priest did not have any knowledge beyond that.

The season turned to autumn, and the day came for Yulong to take the Martial Sect's exam. I accompanied Yulong to the Hollow Rite Cave, my role being to carry his luggage, such as a change of clothes. We went part of the way by carriage, and from the foot of the mountain, we climbed a mountain path on foot. We climbed about three kilometers up the mountain path to reach the location of the Hollow Rite Cave. 

The path was surrounded by tall trees on both sides, making it difficult to see our surroundings. After climbing that path single-mindedly, we saw a building. The location of the Martial Sect was on the mountainside of the highest peak in a chain of several mountains. I was relieved when I saw the beautiful building. The structure, built by carving out the mountainside, was like Kyoto's Kiyomizu Temple magnified many times over, with parts of it made of stone. There was a large gate. In front of it stood two Taoists, who seemed to be handling registration for the exam.

"Are you here to take the exam?"

"Yes. I am Chian Yulong."

"Which exam will you be taking?"

Hearing those words, I tilted my head. Was it divided into desired faculties or departments, like a university exam?

"I wish to be an inner disciple."

"In that case, it will be eight gold coins."

Yulong handed eight gold coins to the Taoist at the reception. An exam fee of eight gold coins... if one gold coin is equivalent to 40,000 yen, that's 320,000 yen. Expensive, ridiculously expensive.

"Give me the luggage."

I handed the luggage to Yulong. He then went inside without another word. What was I supposed to do?

"Are you also taking the exam?" one of the Taoists asked.

"What kinds of exams are there?"

"There are two: the inner disciple exam and the outer disciple exam."

"Is the outer disciple exam also eight gold coins?"

"Of course not. The outer disciple exam is five silver coins."

When I asked about outer disciples, he told me they were apprentice disciples who studied the immortal path while doing miscellaneous chores. It seemed inner disciples learned from the sect's elders, while outer disciples learned from the inner disciples. 

I hesitated. If things continued as they were, Yulong would enter the Martial Sect, and I would end up helping with the shop's business. That would mean working towards becoming a merchant. Did I want to become a merchant?

I remembered when the children were killed in the bandit attack. When I understood that this was a world where a child's life could be taken so easily, I resolved to become stronger. Not only that, but I remembered my previous life where I had worked so desperately to climb the ranks of the police organization, and this time, I wanted to live a free life. 

For that, becoming a Taoist, an existence beyond the reach of even the king's authority, might be a good choice. It might be difficult while I was a disciple, but once I became fully-fledged, I could likely live freely. With that thought, I made my decision.

"I will take the outer disciple exam."

That was my answer. I paid the five silver coins, went inside, and headed for the building that was said to be the examination hall. The exam halls for inner and outer disciples were different; the one for outer disciples was a warehouse-like building. When I entered, six other examinees were waiting for the exam to begin. Their ages ranged from around ten, like me, to men in their thirties. The gender ratio was four men and two women.

"Take your seats, the exam is about to begin. First, we will test your knowledge of the immortal path."

The examiner Taoist's name was DÇ’ng Yimin. He distributed the exam papers, and the test began. I had no problem with the writing utensils, as I had something similar to the portable writing kits, called _yatate_, used in the Edo period. 

I looked at the exam questions and my shoulders slumped. There were only about half the questions I thought I could answer. As expected, taking the exam on the fly was a bit much. But I was thinking of this time as a trial run, with the real attempt next year. 

I somehow managed to write answers for about half the questions before the written exam ended. Looking around, I saw the faces of examinees who looked like they had passed with flying colors. A sigh escaped my lips involuntarily.

"Did you do badly on the written exam?" a boy of about fifteen asked, likely because of my dejected expression. He was the type of boy you'd see as the protagonist of a manga, with sparkling eyes and spiky hair.

"I did."

"Just do your best in the practical exam. I've heard of people who passed because their practical scores were good."

"Thanks. I'll do my best."

"Next, we will check your qi level. Come before me one by one."

The first one was the boy who had just spoken to me.

"Zeng, you're up. First, show me the first level."

Zeng, who had been called, stood and concentrated his spirit, then generated his qi.

"Good. Now, the second level."

Zeng's face grew stern as he circulated his qi with all his might. He somehow managed to begin moving his qi.

"Pass," said the examiner, Yimin.

"Eh?" I couldn't help but let out a voice. Yimin turned his eyes to me.

"What is it?"

"Isn't the passing mark for qi the third level?"

Yimin gave a wry smile.

"That's for inner disciples. For outer disciples, being able to perform up to the second level is a pass."

So that was it. I felt a bit let down. The qi exams continued one after another, and finally, it was my turn. I stepped before the examiner, Yimin, stood naturally, and waited for instructions.

"Alright, the first level."

I immediately generated my qi. Yimin looked slightly surprised.

"You generate your qi quickly. You must have cultivated a great deal. Good, now the second level."

I increased the amount of qi I generated and circulated it through my body. Yimin, having confirmed this, nodded in satisfaction.

"Very well. You pass the qi exam. By the way, can you also do the third level?"

Without answering, I advanced my qi to the third level.

"Splendid. No complaints," Yimin said with a laugh.

"What kind of test is the martial arts exam?" I asked the examiner.

"You will hunt a Fanged Rabbit from the outer edge of the Demonic Domain."

A Fanged Rabbit was a large rabbit, about 120 centimeters long, a demonic beast with sharp fangs. Hearing this, all the examinees looked surprised. Until now, the custom had been to fight the examiner. I didn't know about such customs, but the others were surprised to hear they would be fighting a demonic beast.

"We heard we would be fighting the examiner. Why are we fighting a Fanged Rabbit this year?" Zeng asked.

Hearing this, Yimin sighed.

"Last year, a successful candidate went to gather medicinal herbs, encountered a Fanged Rabbit, and died. Being killed by a Fanged Rabbit, said to be the weakest of the demonic beasts, became an issue, with people saying the passing standards were too lenient."

Come to think of it, I didn't have a weapon.

"Excuse me. What about weapons?"

"You will be allowed to use the spare weapons from the Martial Sect. Of course, if you have your own, you may use that."

We were guided to the armory exclusively for outer disciples. It was almost like a storage shed, and inside were used swords, spears, axes, and the like. The weapons there were not of very good quality, so I chose a small one-handed sword. 

Zeng chose a spear, the two women chose combat staffs, and the remaining men chose swords. The one-handed sword I chose was a thin, double-edged sword with a little rust on it. The other weapons were in a similar state, so I didn't bother exchanging it.

"Once you've chosen your weapons, we're going outside."

At Yimin's signal, we all went out. The mountain where the Martial Sect was located was called Hollow Rite Mountain, and we headed for the outer edge of the Demonic Domain that spread out on the north side of the mountain. We arrived at the edge of the Demonic Domain, and Yimin closed his eyes and seemed to be doing something. I could feel qi from his body, so I knew he was using it.

"That way."

Yimin pointed to the left. After walking a short distance, we saw a single Fanged Rabbit sleeping under a tree.

"First up is Zeng."

Zeng silently nodded at Yimin's whispered instruction. Gripping the spear with both hands, Zeng slowly approached the Fanged Rabbit. The rabbit then noticed, woke up, twisted its face, and let out a growl, baring its fangs. 

I was watching from a slight distance, but even though it was a rabbit, it wasn't cute at all. On the contrary, it was ferocious. It lunged at Zeng with its fangs bared. Zeng struck it with the tip of his spear. 

The Fanged Rabbit rolled on the ground and tried to get up. Zeng ran up to it and beat it mercilessly with his spear. As the tattered Fanged Rabbit lay there, Zeng thrust his spear and delivered the final blow.

"Alright, you pass the martial arts exam."

We found another Fanged Rabbit, and it was the next examinee's turn. This female examinee was afraid of the Fanged Rabbit. As a result, she was about to be bitten, and Yimin had to save her. The next was also a female examinee of about fifteen, but she beat the Fanged Rabbit to death with her combat staff. 

The exam proceeded, and so far, three had defeated a Fanged Rabbit, and the remaining three had not. And finally, it was my turn. Yimin found a Fanged Rabbit and signaled me. It was my first battle with a demonic beast, so I was tense. I drew my sword and cautiously advanced, and the Fanged Rabbit leaped at me with its mouth wide open.

I already understood the Fanged Rabbit's movements from watching the other examinees' fights. I dodged using the body movements of the **Twilight Flash Swordsmanship**, and while rotating my body, I swung the sword down on the rabbit's neck. I felt the impact as the blade of the one-handed sword hit the Fanged Rabbit's neck. 

The sword felt heavy, its edge was dull. Even so, the blade tore through the large blood vessels in its neck. The next moment, the Fanged Rabbit spewed a large amount of blood, fell to the ground, and stopped moving. I was relieved to see it.

"One strike. Amazing," I heard Zeng mutter. The examiner, Yimin, was also wide-eyed.

"Splendid. You undoubtedly have a passing score in martial arts. However, whether you pass or not will likely depend on your score on the written exam."

Hearing that, my shoulders slumped in disappointment. We returned to the examination hall to await the results.
