Around the time Kou and the others began hunting One-Horned Monkeys, Inje found out about it and was puzzled.

"It seems Zeng and the others are hunting One-Horned Monkeys, do you know why?" he asked his friend Shatan, who was reading a book in the library.

"I don't. If you want to know, you should just ask Zeng."

"You're right."

Inje started looking for Zeng but found Ashin instead. Ashin was also one of the group hunting the monkeys.

"Ashin, do you have a moment?"

Ashin, who had just become an outer disciple, tilted her head at the sight of Inje.

"What is it?"

"It seems you're hunting One-Horned Monkeys with Zeng, but what are you doing that for?"

Ashin's expression became wary.

"Why do you ask?"

"I was just wondering if you were doing it for food, and if so, if you'd found a way to make the terrible meat taste good."

"We're not eating it. Have you eaten it before, Senior Brother Inje?"

At that question, Inje averted his gaze. Realizing that Inje had likely eaten the meat of a One-Horned Monkey, Ashin became curious.

"What did it taste like?"

"Don't ask. I don't even want to remember. More importantly, if you're not eating them, why are you hunting them?"

Ashin looked at Inje, as if trying to determine if he could be trusted.

"I think I can trust you, Senior Brother Inje, but Kou told me not to say anything, so I can't."

"Is that so? Understood."

After that, he kept a casual eye on the activities of Zeng, Ashin, and Kou, and he figured out what they were doing. The three of them were hunting One-Horned Monkeys for their pelts, processing them into rugs, and selling them. He didn't know the exact figures, but it seemed they were making a surprisingly large profit for outer disciples who had just joined. Inje went to see Shatan.

"I figured out what Zeng and the others are up to."

"What are you talking about?"

“The reason they hunt One-Horned Monkeys.”

"Oh, did you hear it from Zeng?"

"Kou seems to have told them to keep quiet, so I did some digging."

Shatan gave a wry smile.

"That's not a very respectable hobby."

"I was curious, so I couldn't help it. Anyway, the goal was the One-Horned Monkey pelts. They were making them into rugs and selling them."

Shatan tilted his head.

"One-Horned Monkey pelts? Are they really that good?"

Shatan and Inje had also defeated One-Horned Monkeys before. Their purpose at the time had been the meat, so they hadn't collected the pelts. And when they found out the meat was shockingly bad, they lost all interest in the monkeys.

"Want to go hunt some One-Horned Monkeys?"

"Are you going to interfere with our cute juniors?"

"That's not it. I just want to see for myself how good the pelts are."

"If that's the case, then I'm in."

The next day, Inje and Shatan headed for the Demonic Domain. Inje was armed with a longsword, and Shatan with a spear. The One-Horned Monkey habitat they were heading to was further north than where Kou and the others were hunting. They didn't want to disturb their juniors' hunting ground. While searching for the monkeys, they came across a scene where three of them were digging in the ground.

"What are they doing?"

"It looks like they're looking for insects that live underground."

"They haven't noticed us, so let's rush them and take them out all at once."

The two of them timed their charge, and as they neared the One-Horned Monkeys, they attacked. Inje's longsword slashed a monkey's neck, and Shatan's spear pierced another's back. The remaining one attacked Inje, but he kicked it, and as it tumbled, he finished it off with his longsword. Then, they skinned them. After they finished, Inje stared at the exposed meat of the One-Horned Monkey.

"You're not thinking of taking that meat back, are you?" Shatan said, giving Inje a sidelong glance.

"Many of the outer disciples haven't had the precious experience of eating One-Horned Monkey meat. So if we take the meat back..."

"Let's not."

Shatan didn't let him finish.

"If you do that, everyone will hate you."

At those words, Inje let out a sigh. Seeing the monkey meat brought back old memories. It was strange that the fur didn't do the same. After that, they hunted three more One-Horned Monkeys and got their pelts. Now that they had enough pelts to make rugs for the two of them, they returned to the Hollow Rite Cave and salted the pelts in the storeroom. The salting was to prevent the pieces of flesh attached to the pelts from rotting.

The next day, they took the pelts to the city and asked a leather craftsman to make them into rugs. A few days later, Inje and Shatan went to the craftsman's place and received the finished rugs.

"I had no idea One-Horned Monkey fur felt this good," Inje said, stroking the finished rug. Shatan also checked the texture and nodded. The freshly skinned pelts had been dirty and didn't feel good, but the finished rugs were like a completely different thing.

"Let's try them out tonight."

"They seemed to be trading for quite a high price, so they might be good quality."

After returning to the Hollow Rite Cave, Inje lay down on the One-Horned Monkey rug that night.

"Oh, it's warm. It's a world of difference from when I only had a thin mattress."

Inje closed his eyes, feeling happy.

The next morning, he didn't want to get out from under his covers. The One-Horned Monkey rug was that warm and comfortable. Inje went to Shatan's place to ask for his opinion.

"How was the rug?"

Shatan grinned.

"Maybe it's because it's the fur of a demonic beast, but it's incredibly warm. I can see why Zeng and the others are continuing to hunt them."

"You said 'Zeng and the others' just now, but it might be better to say 'Kou and the others'."

When Inje said this, Shatan looked at him as if to say, 'What are you talking about?'

"Among Kou, Zeng, and Ashin, the one at the center seems to be Kou."

"But Kou is the youngest."

"You've spoken to Kou before, haven't you, Shatan? Didn't you think he was quite mature for a child who just turned ten?"

Shatan nodded.

“True. I wonder who he really is. Now I’m curious too.”
