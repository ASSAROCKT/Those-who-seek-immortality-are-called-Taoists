My name is Shibuya Nijiko, and I'm a detective with the Metropolitan Police Department. And not just any detective at a local precinct. I'm with the Second Investigation Division of the MPD headquarters. 

The Second Division investigates white-collar crimes like fraud, counterfeiting, and bribery. I've built a solid record here, rising to the rank of Assistant Inspector. It has nothing to do with my job, but I also make an effort to have people see me as a dandy gentleman. Currently, I'm in charge of a bribery case involving a construction company.

"Shibuya-san, are you sure it's okay to continue this investigation? Section Chief Toda told you to back off, didn't he?" my junior detective, Mitsukoshi, asked.

It seemed that pressure had come from a politician connected to the construction company. It was a common enough story, but I didn't back down. It wasn't because of some belief in justice or a conviction not to bow to power. I simply figured that if I could arrest a major figure here, a promotion was all but guaranteed. However, I knew better than to voice my true intentions. I turned to Mitsukoshi, putting on an expression of someone burning with a sense of justice.

“It’s fine. If we get the evidence, even the section chief can’t complain. More importantly, Mitsukoshi— that whistleblower is the real deal, right?”

"No problem. The information is from a reliable source."

An employee at the construction company in question had leaked to the police that a company executive and a certain politician were going to meet in secret. According to the information, the two would secretly meet at a building under construction to exchange a bribe. Given the nature of bribe money, it made sense that it would be exchanged in cash rather than a bank transfer. My partner Mitsukoshi and I planned to stake out the building to secure the evidence.

Getting out of the car, we used the key entrusted to us by the informant to enter the building under construction. We then climbed the stairs to the fifth floor, where we had been told the exchange would take place. Arriving on the fifth floor, I looked around and saw windows still without glass panes and walls of bare concrete.

"Is this really the place?"

When I asked Mitsukoshi to confirm, he nodded with a dark expression. Just as I felt something was wrong, three ill-favored men appeared from around a corner and approached us. Then, Mitsukoshi stepped away from me.

"This is your fault."

"What do you mean?"

"If you had just backed off when the Section Chief told you to, it wouldn't have come to this."

This was bad. Very, very bad. My partner, Mitsukoshi, had betrayed me. At this rate, I was going to be killed. The three men closing in had the air of professional thugs. I'd learned Shorinji Kempo, but I wasn't exactly skilled in brawling. I strongly regretted not having practiced more seriously.

"Did they get some dirt on you?"

"They did. They found out I caused an accident while driving drunk."

I told him that while he'd probably have to quit being a detective if he reported it honestly, it was better than being an accomplice to murder. Mitsukoshi just shook his head with a frightened look. I was cornered against a window frame, empty of glass. At that moment, one of the three men threw a front kick. It was a sharp kick, but I somehow managed to scoop it up with my right arm and kick him in the groin. The man screamed and collapsed. In that same instant, another man's fist slammed into my stomach. I couldn't stay standing and crumpled. Then, I was shoved out of the window.

As I fell through the air, I wondered what had gone wrong. It was a thought that lasted less than a second, and in the next moment, my consciousness was swallowed by darkness.
