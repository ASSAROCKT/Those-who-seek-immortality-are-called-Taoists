About a year after I joined the Chian Trading Company, Yulong suddenly summoned me.

"Is there something you need?"

"Go to the blacksmith and pick up the sword I ordered."

After asking for the specific location, I received a claim ticket and a wrapping cloth for the sword from the steward, Li Fan.

"The sword you are to receive was made for fifty gold coins. I would have preferred to send an adult to fetch it, but Master Yulong ordered that you would be fine. Be careful."

Fan, a reasonably competent steward, seemed to be against the idea of sending a child like me to pick up such an expensive sword. But the sheltered young master had apparently designated me. I didn't know what Yulong was thinking. 

I left the estate and headed for the blacksmith. It had been a while since I'd walked through the city. I was tempted to take a detour, but I suppressed the urge and went straight to the smithy. The blacksmith was located about eight hundred meters west of the company. When I entered, my eyes were drawn to the various weapons of all sizes on display. I was drawn to the place where the swords were lined up and gazed at them.

"A sword is too soon for you, kid. What's your business?" said a man who appeared to be the master of the shop, looking at me. Right. I had to run Yulong's errand.

"I am Kou, from the Chian Trading Company. I've come to pick up the sword Master Yulong requested."

"Ah, the order from the Chian Trading Company. I'm Yun Zhaoxi."

So he was the master. When I showed him the claim ticket, the master went to the back and returned with a sword. It was an ornate, gaudily decorated weapon. I couldn't tell how sharp it was, but I could see at a glance that it was expensive. The master had a dissatisfied look on his face; it seemed he himself wasn't fond of such ostentatiously decorated swords.

"Check it to make sure it's correct."

"Even if you say so, I wasn't told what kind of sword was ordered..."

"Look at the claim ticket. The order was for a sharp sword, with a scabbard decorated with a golden dragon motif and a red jewel embedded in the hilt."

The same was written on the claim ticket. The appearance was as ordered. However, I couldn't tell if it was sharp just by looking at it.

"Want to do a test cut?" the master said with a wry smile.

“Am I allowed to?”

"You won't know the sharpness without trying. A straw bundle will do, right?"

till doubting, I drew the sword. I carefully placed the scabbard on a nearby stand to avoid damaging it. The master looked at me mockingly, as if to say, _You really think you can pull this off?_

The sword Yulong had commissioned was a one-handed sword, slightly heavier than what I considered ideal no doubt balanced for Yulong’s strength, so for me, being younger, it felt heavy. But it wasn’t unmanageable. I gave it a few practice swings, producing a faint whistle through the air. The master’s expression shifted.

"You, have you studied the sword?"

"I've practiced a little. It's nothing special."

I approached the straw bundle and swung the sword in a diagonal slash. The bundle was easily cut in two, and the upper part of the severed bundle danced in the air. As expected of a fifty-gold-coin sword.

I checked the blade and saw no nicks. The master picked up the fallen straw and examined the cut surface.

"The cross-section is clean. This could sever a man's neck."

I gave a wry smile, though it didn't quite suit a child's face.

"Please don't say such scary things. But it certainly does seem to be sharp."

As I returned the sword to its scabbard and wrapped it in the cloth, I heard the master mutter.

"Who is this kid? That's not the skill of a brat."

I pretended not to hear, left the claim ticket, said my thanks, and left the blacksmith. After walking a short distance toward the estate, I noticed I was being followed. They must have seen a child come out carrying a package with great care and thought me an easy target. There was a stretch with few people on the way back to the estate, an area with many vacant lots where many of the poor lived. Even if I took a detour, there would still be deserted places. I steeled myself and decided to press on. In case of an emergency, I unwrapped the cloth from the sword so I could draw it immediately. Just as the street became deserted, a large man jumped out in front of me.

"Stop, kid."

The man who blocked my path had a disgusting smile on his face. He held a knife in his hand, waving it around as if to threaten me.

"Leave all your valuables and go."

When I tried to run, he thrust the knife at me threateningly.

"You think you can get away? Hurry up and leave your valuables."

At that moment, I noticed a carriage approaching from behind the mugger. It stopped right behind him.

"What are you doing?"

I heard a very young woman's voice, and a girl about my age got out of the carriage. She wore expensive clothes, suggesting she was the daughter of a wealthy merchant or a high-ranking official. The decorated carriage was also clearly expensive.

"Don't come any closer! This man is a mugger!" I warned.

Despite my warning, the girl calmly approached the mugger. A coachman and a woman who appeared to be a servant were in the carriage, but they only called out "Please come back!" and made no move to get out.

"I aim to become a Taoist. A mugger like this is no problem for me."

It seemed she, like Yulong, was trying to enter a Martial Sect. Naturally, she must be learning the basics of the immortal path, qi cultivation, and martial arts. Looking closely, I saw she was a stunningly beautiful girl with the long limbs of a model. She held something like a staff in her hand.

"Don't interfere!"

The large man swung his knife at the girl. She dodged nimbly and struck the man's hand with the staff she held. The impact sent the man's knife flying.

"Damn it!"

The large man charged at the girl as if to tackle her. She tried to evade with an elegant step, but the ground was uneven, and she stumbled on a stone.

"Ah!"

Seeing the girl stagger and cry out, the large man grinned. He reached out to grab her. In that instant, I moved. I grabbed the man's hand and, using both of my hands, applied a wrist lock.

"Ow! What the hell are you doing!?"

_Isn't he an idiot?_ I thought, as I put my weight into the joint lock and threw him. The large man, thrown onto the hard ground without being able to break his fall, seemed to have lost consciousness. The girl was staring at me with a reproachful look, as if to say, _If you could win, you should have fought from the start._ But he had a knife. There's always a chance of an accident, so I think trying to run if you can is the right answer.

"Thank you for helping me," I said. It was a fact that she had tried to help me, so I thanked her.

"It seems my help wasn't needed."

"No, he had a knife. Just disarming him was a great help."

I picked up the sword I had dropped on the ground to help the girl.

"Is that a sword?"

I nodded in response to the girl's question.

"Yes. It is Master Yulong's sword."

Hearing the name Yulong, the girl frowned. Was she an acquaintance of Yulong's, and perhaps not on good terms with him?

"Are you from the Chian Trading Company?"

"I am Kou, a servant attending to Master Yulong."

"I am Tan Chunlin. Don't tell Yulong about this."

Did she not want to have anything to do with Yulong? But she was my benefactor, so I would obey her request.

"Understood. But what should we do about the mugger?"

"I'll have my servant call the guards. Could you wait a moment?"

And so we waited for the guards to arrive, explained the situation to them, and handed over the mugger. After that, I parted ways with Shunlin and returned to the Chian Trading Company, only to be scolded by Yulong for being late. This was because I kept my promise to Shunlin and didn't mention the encounter with the mugger. But even being scolded by Yulong, I was able to take it calmly, just thinking of it as being scolded by a child. Yulong, somehow sensing this attitude, gave me a displeased look.

"From tomorrow, you will participate in martial arts practice. I will specially allow you to be my training partner."

"But, my martial arts..."

"Silence. Don't complain."

And so, I had no choice but to participate in the martial arts practice. The martial art Yulong was learning was of the Nanling School, which seemed to specialize in flexible body movements and counters. This was trouble. If I used Shaolin Kung Fu or **Twilight Flash Swordsmanship**, I might be able to fight him on equal terms, but it would surely put Yulong in a bad mood. It would be a problem if I got kicked out of the Chian Trading Company at this point. So, I decided to devote myself to being the losing partner.

The next day, I went to the garden where Yulong was practicing his martial arts. Yulong and his martial arts teacher were waiting. The teacher was a martial artist named Lián Xiaodong, a man of about forty. He was a martial artist of such skill that I stood no chance of winning against him at my current level. The quickest way to beat him would probably be to learn authentic immortal arts. If I tried to win with martial arts alone, it would likely take more than ten years, and that's assuming I could continue to improve my skills at my current pace.

"Master Yulong, I heard that Kou has not learned martial arts. Wouldn't he be an unsuitable training partner?"

"Why don't we decide that after we try?"

"Very well."

Not very well for me. Neither of them seemed to have any intention of asking for my opinion. In the end, I became Yulong's training dummy. As sparring with swords was out of the question, I was his partner for unarmed practice. I ran around and defended without using Shaolin Kung Fu. As a result, my whole body was covered in bruises.

"Don't run away. Fight!" Yulong said unreasonably. If I resisted seriously, he was bound to get angry.

Yulong unleashed a roundhouse kick as if to finish me off. I blocked it with both arms and threw myself backward. I hit the ground, rolled over and over, and pretended to have lost consciousness.

"Tch, as I thought, this guy is useless even as a training dummy."

Hearing this, Xiaodong gave a wry smile. After a little while, I got up as if I had just come to and put on a show of being in exaggerated pain.

"You're in the way, get out!" Yulong bellowed.

I limped toward the mansion. Then, I glanced back and shot a look at Yulong.

_'You hit me as much as you pleased. One day, I'll beat you to a pulp.'_

Yulong was looking at me with an expression that said, _'Useless.'_

◆◆◇◇◆◆◇◇◆◆

Yulong, having driven Kou away, had a satisfied expression on his face.

"Master Yulong, why did you decide to make that boy your partner?" Xiaodong asked.

Yulong's well-featured face twisted.

"That guy is insolent."

"Is that so? He seemed to obey your orders without question."

"He may obey my orders, but his eyes are defiant. I feel like he doesn't acknowledge me as his master."

"Aren't you overthinking it? However, watching the practice just now, I did feel that the boy is used to fighting."

Yulong tilted his head.

"What do you mean?"

"He was watching your attacks closely. It just seems he was unable to dodge them."
