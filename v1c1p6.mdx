Yimin brought the written exam papers back to the exam preparation room and began grading them. In this room, the examiners for the inner disciple exam were also grading.

"Yimin, how are the outer disciples this year?" asked Lóng Zǐhán, a Taoist from the same cohort.

"They're so-so. But there was one kid with a talent for qi and martial arts."

"Oh? Did that kid pass?"

"No, unfortunately, his written exam score is a shame."

The passing line was seventy points, but Kou's score was only about fifty.

"Just pass him. You're in charge, right? Besides, they're just outer disciples. They'll be doing chores, so it doesn't matter if they're a little dumb."

"I suppose that's true. But it's a waste. If his written exam score had been good too, he has enough talent that it wouldn't be strange for him to become an inner disciple."

"He's an outer disciple, right? The clever ones are insolent. It's better if they're a little stupid, it makes them more endearing."

Hearing this, Yimin laughed.

"Don't say such cruel things. He was only about ten years old. He might still grow."

Zǐhán laughed and shook his head.

"A person's intelligence is pretty much set by the time they're ten. Even if there's room for growth, it's only a tiny bit, isn't it?"

"You never know. He might be a late bloomer."

"Hmph, someone like that comes along only once in ten, or even a hundred years."

◆◆◇◇◆◆◇◇◆◆

Yimin returned and announced the results. I had thought I failed, but when he told me I had passed, I was overcome with happiness.

"Did I really pass?"

"In your case, Kou, your written exam score did not reach the passing mark. However, I judged that you would be able to learn after joining. Make sure you study properly."

"Understood. Thank you very much."

After that, an explanation was given to those of us who had become outer disciples. Outer disciples live in a dormitory-like building called the Outer Quarters. It seems that by collecting medicinal herbs and delivering them to the apothecary, outer disciples can earn some pocket money. The problem was how to quit the Chian Trading Company, but if Yulong had passed, it would be easier to leave. Come to think of it, had the inner disciple exam finished?

"Senior Brother Yimin, is the inner disciple exam over?" I asked Yimin to confirm. 

"No, not yet. Is an acquaintance of yours taking it?"

"Yes."

He said it would take about another _hankoku_, so I figured I should just wait in front of the gate. When Yulong came out, I should be able to tell from his demeanor whether he had passed or failed. For reference, since the day is customarily divided into twelve parts, a _hankoku_ is about one hour, and an _ikkoku_ is about two. It seemed we had to move into the Outer Quarters within ten days. Yimin handed out admission certificates to those of us who had become outer disciples. Each was a wooden plaque, about six by eight centimeters, branded with the seal of the Hollow Rite Cave, with our names inscribed below.

After giving my thanks, I went outside and waited for Yulong in front of the gate. After about a _hankoku_— one hour in my old world's terms— had passed, Yulong came out, smiling. It seemed he had passed.

"You, were you waiting?" Yulong called out when he spotted me. Then he tossed his luggage at me.

I caught the luggage, let out a sigh I tried to conceal, and began walking behind Yulong. Upon returning to the Chian Trading Company, Yulong reported to his father that he had passed the inner disciple exam.

"Well done! With this, we have a connection to the Hollow Rite Cave. Taoists wear fine clothes, you know. This will surely be good for business."

I was listening from behind Yulong and judged that now, while the master was in a good mood, was the perfect opportunity to announce my departure.

"Master, if Master Yulong is going to the Hollow Rite Cave, what will become of me?"

Chian Shao glared at me.

"Hmph, you'll just do other chores."

"What? I still have to do chores?"

"If you don't like it, you're free to leave."

His eyes seemed to say, _You should be grateful that I'm employing you when you have nowhere else to go._

"Then I will leave. Thank you for everything until now."

I bowed my head deeply and was about to leave the room.

"Wait. What are you thinking? Are you planning to return to your hometown?"

"No, I have found work I wish to do, so I intend to change my profession."

Chian Shao frowned.

"You fool. You're probably chasing some impossible dream. It's always people like you who end up dying in a ditch. Do as you please."

"Excuse me."

I said that and left the room. I noticed Yulong looking at me with a cold gaze. I almost sighed. I would be living in the same Martial Sect as this Yulong, so we would likely see each other again. That alone was a bit depressing. I gathered my belongings and left the company. 

My fellow servants looked at me as if I were a fool. I didn't know if I would succeed as a Taoist, but I hated the idea of remaining weak. Even now, I still have dreams of the bandit attack. The faces of the children, frightened and on the verge of tears, are burned into my mind.
