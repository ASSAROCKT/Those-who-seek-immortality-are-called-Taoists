In the south of the Shiei Continent lay a mountainous region called the Sacred Chain Mountains. It was a terrain of towering, continuous peaks, with plains of various sizes scattered at their bases. On each of these plains rested a small kingdom, and in a frontier region of a country near the center lived a single child.

"Why? Why did you betray me?"

The small child lying in bed sat up, uttering incomprehensible words as if delirious. A woman who had been watching him with a worried expression called out.

"Kou, are you all right?"

A gentle voice, speaking a language that wasn't Japanese but which he could somehow understand, reached his ears, and he nodded reflexively.

"I'm fine."

I was born as Kou, the fifth son of Den Sei, a father who ran a small shop on the frontier, and Ien, my mother. For three days, I had been bedridden with a fever. The reason for the fever was that I had remembered my previous life. From that day forward, I became the nine-year-old child known as Kou, who possessed the memories of being a detective named Shibuya Kou. It seemed my brain had overheated in the process of merging the memories of Shibuya Kou and Kou, causing the fever.

"Do you want something to eat?"

When I nodded, my mother brought me a type of steamed bun called mantou and some water. As I ate the mantou, I contemplated what had happened. I had the memories of Kou, the fifth son of the shopkeeper Den Sei. However, I also had memories from before that, of my time as a detective in Japan. I was confused. The ordeal exhausted me, so after I finished eating, I fell asleep again.

When I woke the next day, my father and brothers had gone to the shop, and only my mother remained. Kou’s family consisted of his parents and four older brothers, but only the eldest, Den Wen, was to stay home and inherit the shop; the other three brothers had left home for service. The only ones left in this house were my parents, Den Wen, and myself. After somehow managing to relieve my worried mother's concerns, I returned to my usual life. 

That said, as Kou was a nine-year-old child, he had no real work. Apart from helping with sweeping the house, drawing water, and preparing meals, he was free. When my father returned in the evening, he looked at my face and nodded.

"Looks like you've recovered. Now the favor I asked of Ruu-san won't have been for nothing."

Hearing this, I scowled. Ruu was a man who worked as a broker for apprenticeships, and he had found a position for me. It was at a shop called the "Chian Trading Company," a textile wholesaler in Boushin, the second-largest city in the country. The master there was said to be a great merchant named Chian Shao. The Chian family was one of the most prominent merchant houses in the country, and the family head, Shao, apparently had connections to many powerful figures. It seemed my father wanted to send me to the Chian Trading Company as an apprentice to build a connection with the Chian family.

"Kou, you're a smart boy. Study before you leave for your apprenticeship so you can make a good impression on your master."

My father looked pleased. I then asked him to introduce me to the head priest of the town’s temple. Nine-year-old Kou knew almost nothing about this world. I thought I would try to learn from the priest, who was the most knowledgeable person in town.

The next day, my mother took me to the temple. It was small and quite dilapidated.

"We ask for your guidance," my mother said as she explained the situation.

"I will teach him what I know," the priest replied.

My mother bowed her head and went home. Left alone, I sat on a long bench in an open-sided rest house within the temple grounds and began to speak with the priest. The priest was a small, thin monk of about fifty, but his back was perfectly straight.

"This country is ruled by a king, correct?"

Hearing this, the priest laughed.

"It is not so simple. The king does not rule over everything. There are those who exist outside the king's dominion."

I tilted my head. "What kind of people are they?"

"They are those who study the immortal arts, seeking eternal life. They are called 'Taoists,' and among them, those who have achieved immortality are called 'the Deathless' or 'divine immortals'."

Perhaps because of the doubtful look in my eyes, the priest gave a wry smile. After listening to his detailed explanation, it seemed that Taoists and divine immortals were not things of legend or superstition, but truly existed. This made me realize that this place was, at the very least, not Earth. In my previous life as a detective, I would never have believed it. But having experienced reincarnation myself, I found I could believe it without question.

"Divine immortals and Taoists truly exist. I myself have met a Taoist, though only one."

"What kind of person were they?"

"A man of about thirty. I saw him fly away on a cloud."

"Taoists can ride on clouds? I'd like to try that."

The priest laughed. "For that, you must become a Taoist. However, it is said that only one in ten thousand possesses the talent to become one."

The priest himself did not seem to know how one's talent was determined. I learned reading, writing, and the country's history and geography from the priest. My mother had taught me to read and write, but my knowledge was half-baked, so I studied so as not to be troubled when I began my apprenticeship.

The civilization of this country resembled that of Tang Dynasty China. The architectural styles and clothing were similar as well. That said, my knowledge of history was shallow, so I could only tell that they looked alike. Incidentally, the clothes I wore were coarse and patched. 

As it was summer, I could endure the shabby clothes, but when winter came, I would need to acquire winter garments. I would probably have to buy them with the wages I received from my apprenticeship. Or perhaps my new masters would provide them?

About three months after I began my studies, the day came for me to depart for my apprenticeship. My mother shed tears, sad to see me go, but my father and my brother Den Wen only offered a single word: "Good luck." I boarded the cart of the broker, Ruu, and set off for Boushin, a journey of about eight days by cart. 

Boushin was said to be so prosperous it was called the Boushin Trade City, where all the major merchant houses had shops. There were four other children traveling with me to Boushin, all around my age, who were also going to serve as apprentices in the city's shops. However, I was the only one going to the Chian Trading Company.

The food during the cart journey was abysmal. What's more, the vibrations were so intense my hips and lower back ached. Other than that, six days passed without incident. Then, around noon on the seventh day, Ruu, who was driving the cart, suddenly stopped the horses.

"No..."

I heard Ruu's voice. It was laced with fear, and sensing that something had happened, I stuck my head out of the cart to look outside. Eight men were blocking the path ahead of the cart. It looked like there were more behind us as well.

"No... it can't be bandits."

Hearing the word "bandits," the other children began to cry. This was bad, a very bad situation. I had heard about the bandits of this world from the priest, their way was apparently to slaughter everyone they attacked. At this rate, we would be killed. If I didn't escape right now, my chances would only get worse. But was I really going to abandon these children and run away by myself?

"Everyone, we're going to be killed if we stay here! Anyone who doesn't want to die, run with me!"

With that, I jumped out of the cart. The bandits blocking the front and back of the cart noticed and shouted.

"A brat's come out!"

The bandits started running. I bolted into the forest that spread out beside the road. I could sense them chasing me from behind. I ran for my life and, by a stroke of luck, managed to escape. It was a good thing I chose to flee through a dense thicket of thin trees and was careful not to leave footprints once I had put some distance between us.

"Hah... hah... No one followed me."

Those frightened children were probably unable to move. I regretted running away by myself. Was there nothing else I could have done? This feeling was likely influenced by the sense of responsibility I had as a detective. ...Forget it. I'm a nine-year-old boy. What could I do against bandits? There was no point in dwelling on negative thoughts. 

I was lucky to have escaped, so I should think positively and focus on living. I began walking in what I presumed was the direction of the road. After about thirty minutes, I was able to get back to it. Ahead lay a town called Korta, and behind me should be the cart we were riding in.

"The cart... is probably a gruesome sight."

I had no desire to check. I had seen enough of that sort of thing during my time as a detective. I began walking steadfastly toward the next town. This road was poorly maintained, but it was a main thoroughfare with a lot of traffic. Wolves and boars were said to appear, but it was rare for them to come out onto the road itself. As I was walking toward the town of Korta, I noticed a presence approaching from behind.

"Don't tell me, bandits?"

I veered off the road and entered the forest. Peeking out from behind a tree, I saw a large group of men, their bodies stained with blood, walking along. One of them was carrying a bag. I recognized that bag. It was the one the broker Ruu had been carrying. They were the bandits, no doubt about it. Where were they going? Curious, I decided to follow them. I knew it was dangerous, but for some reason, I felt I had to. The feeling that I had abandoned the other children and Ruu was probably what drove me. Tailing was my specialty. The bandits followed the road for a short distance before entering the forest at a spot marked by a large, towering tree.

"Their hideout might be in there."

I considered trying to locate their hideout, but I felt it would be too dangerous to go any further, so I continued along the road toward the town. And so, I arrived at the town of Korta. There were guards standing at the town entrance, checking those who sought to enter. As I approached the entrance, a guard must have thought I looked suspicious. He walked over and asked me.

"Hey, kid. Did something happen?"

I looked at the guard. He wasn't tall but had a sturdy build. He wore what appeared to be a simplified version of armor called scale mail and carried something like a six-foot staff.

"The cart I was riding in was attacked by bandits."

"Is that true?"

"I'm not lying."

The guard stared intently at my face, then signaled to another guard before turning his eyes back to me.

"Come with me."

The guard entered the town and started walking toward the center. Korta was a small town with a population of about fifteen hundred, so the number of guards was not very large. The buildings were mostly wooden and two stories high. The guard went to the barracks. Then, he found the captain and told me to tell my story again. I recounted everything that had happened since we encountered the bandits.

"Understood. First, we'll check on the cart. You wait in an empty room."

◆◆◇◇◆◆◇◇◆◆

Han, the captain of the Korta town guard, asked his subordinate, Lian, about the child from before.

"Lian, what do you make of that kid?"

"He's quite composed for his age, isn't he?"

"He's _too_ composed. Is it possible he's had some kind of training?"

"You're overthinking it, sir. He said he's the son of a merchant from the frontier."

“Is that so? But think on it— when surrounded by bandits, he had the presence of mind to flee at once. Even pursued, he managed to escape. That’s no ordinary child. Any normal one would have been caught.”

"Now that you mention it, that's true."

"And that's not all. After returning to the road and spotting the bandits, he tailed them and investigated the possible direction of their hideout. That's difficult even for an adult."

"Who could he be?"

"I don't know. But at his age, it's unlikely he's a criminal. Well, no matter. Let's confirm the situation with the cart before we start probing into the kid."

Captain Han took several guards and headed along the road toward the frontier. Leading the guards, Captain Han hurried west on horseback. After riding for about two hours, they discovered the cart.

"To do something so horrible, and to children..." Lian said, his face hardening.

Captain Han nodded in agreement and counted the number of slain children. It matched the number Kou had told them.

"Let's transport the bodies to town."

"What about the bandits?"

"Once we've gathered more men, we'll find their hideout and crush them."

The guards decided to carry the bodies back in the cart. The original horses had apparently been stolen by the bandits, so they had Captain Han's horse pull it.
