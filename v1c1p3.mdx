While resting in my barracks room, I must have dozed off sitting in a chair. When I woke up, it was already dark outside. Hungry, I left the room to look for something to eat, and found a dining hall.

"Oh, you're awake?" 

one of the guards called out. He seemed to know I had been sleeping, likely having come to check on me. Two small lamps were hanging in the dining hall, illuminating the interior.

"Has the captain returned yet?"

"Not yet. If you're hungry, there's some mantou* in the kitchen."

"Thank you very much."

Since he said I could eat, I went into the kitchen to find the mantou. After eating two cold mantou, I waited in the dining hall, and soon Captain Han returned.

"You're Kou, right? It was just as you said. Everyone who remained with the cart had been slaughtered."

Hearing this, my expression darkened. I had expected it, but knowing the outcome for certain filled my heart with a cold feeling. However, thanks to the resilience I'd built from the experiences in my past life, I recovered in a short time.

"Aren't you going to subjugate the bandits?"

"Of course we will. But only after we've made sufficient preparations."

“Then… what should I do?”

Captain Han thought for a moment before telling me to stay here until the bandit subjugation was complete.

"If we succeed in wiping them out, it will be your achievement as well. You should receive a reward from the Prefectural Magistrate."

The official who governed this region centered around Korta was a civil official appointed by the king, known as a 'Prefectural Magistrate'. This country's system of local governance was to appoint a Prefectural Magistrate to manage a region above the village and town heads. 

This magistrate was responsible for trials and tax collection. And so, I was to stay in the room I'd been given and wait for the bandit subjugation to end. That night, for some reason, I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep. After going outside to use the lavatory, I was about to return to my room when I noticed light leaking from a room at the end of the hall. I approached and peeked inside, where I saw Captain Han seemingly engaged in some kind of training.

"Who's there?"

It seemed I had been noticed. I entered the room and showed my face.

"It's me. I saw the light and came to see who it was."

“Oh! just you, brat. What are you doing up at this hour?”

"I'm on my way back from the lavatory. What were you doing, Captain?"

"Martial arts training."

“In a place this cramped?”

Captain Han picked up a book from the table. It was a thin volume that looked like some kind of secret martial arts manual.

"This is the secret manual of a martial art that has been passed down through generations of Korta's guard captains. However, my predecessor's predecessor died suddenly before he could pass on the oral traditions, so they were lost."

It seemed that the martial art in the manual could only be mastered when one had both the secret text and the oral traditions.

"But you're still practicing it, aren't you?"

"I'm researching to see if it can be mastered even without the oral traditions."

"Have you been able to master it?"

"As I thought, it seems difficult without the oral traditions... Hmm? Why am I telling you all this?"

Captain Han tilted his head. I wanted to see the secret manual.

"Could you let me see that secret manual?"

"Are you an idiot? This is passed down from one guard captain to the next."

"But you can't master it without the oral traditions, right? In that case, you could let me see it."

Captain Han gave a wry smile. Judging from his expression, it seemed he had almost completely given up on mastering it. Captain Han tossed the secret manual toward me. If the oral traditions had been passed down, he surely wouldn't have treated it so carelessly. 

I caught the manual and flipped through it, looking inside. Characters similar to the kanji of this country were lined up. Among them were a few characters from a slightly different system. They resembled Bonji, the characters of ancient Sanskrit. I could read the kanji parts, but the Bonji were incomprehensible.

I have one special skill. It's a skill I've had since my time as a detective in my previous life, something called 'perfect instantaneous recall' or 'eidetic memory'. It is the ability to instantly memorize visual information and retain it as clearly as a photograph forever. I used that ability to memorize the contents of the secret manual. 

However, even if I memorized it, I didn't know if I could understand it. With this kind of memory, one might think I was quite smart. But aside from memory, I was average, so my school grades were in the upper-middle range. However, when I was a detective, I memorized a vast number of mugshots and arrested many wanted fugitives, which got me promoted to the rank of police inspector.

"Thank you."

I immediately returned the secret manual.

"Go to bed now."

I returned to my room and slept.

The next day, I spent my time checking the contents of the memorized secret manual. I could understand the general parts, but the sections that seemed to describe the secrets were written in Bonji and thus incomprehensible, making them impossible to learn.

"If only I knew what these Bonji-like characters meant."

The secret manual described a qi cultivation method called 'Twilight and Dawn Art' and a one-handed sword style called 'Twilight Flash Swordsmanship'. The footwork of the one-handed sword style had a unique design, and the term 'Flash Step' was written. The Flash Step was a footwork method for closing the distance to an opponent in an instant without being noticed, apparently making it seem like teleportation to the opponent. 

If only I could understand the Bonji parts, this would be an incredibly useful martial art. However, the qi cultivation method and the Flash Step parts had too much Bonji to even practice, but the one-handed sword style parts seemed practicable. This was likely the part Captain Han had been training.

"Something else might happen, so I should at least practice the one-handed sword style."

I decided to practice the Twilight Flash Swordsmanship.

Two days later, the bandit subjugation was carried out, and the bandits were annihilated. The stolen money and goods were reportedly left at their hideout and recovered. As the one who had officially reported the location of the hideout, I was given twenty silver coins by the Prefectural Magistrate. 

For the record, the currency came in types called bronze cash, copper coins, half-silver coins, silver coins, half-gold coins, and gold coins, corresponding to about 10 yen, 100 yen, 2,500 yen, 5,000 yen, 20,000 yen, and 40,000 yen, respectively. One silver coin was equivalent to 5,000 Japanese yen, so twenty silver coins were about 100,000 yen. For a child like me, it was a huge sum of money.

"There are a lot of pickpockets, so be careful," one of the guards warned. After that, I left the barracks and looked for a cart heading to the Boushin Trade City. There was a stagecoach, so I decided to use that.

"How much to Boushin?" I asked the stagecoach driver.

"Are you alone?"

"I'm going to the Chian Trading Company in Boushin for an apprenticeship."

"Hoh, the Chian Trading Company, eh? You're apprenticing at a big shop. Oh, right, the price. It's one silver coin."

"Then, I'd like a ride."

I boarded the stagecoach and headed for Boushin. This time, I arrived in Boushin without incident. I asked the driver for the location of the Chian Trading Company and headed there. The Chian Trading Company was a large shop. When I explained my situation to a person at the shop, I was taken to the Chian family residence located behind it.

"Master, I've brought the boy that the broker, Ruu, promised."

The master, Chian Shao, was a large, stout man.

"Is Ruu not with him?"

"He was killed by bandits, sir."

"To have encountered such a disaster and survived. You seem to be a lucky one. We'll make him a servant for Yulong."

Yulong was the second son of the Chian family. I was assigned to take care of Yulong and began living in a large room used by the servants. I would wake up early in the morning to prepare water for Yulong to wash his face, clean his room, and do other chores. 

Yulong was a twelve-year-old boy with a slender build and the features of a young nobleman, which made him very popular with the daughters of merchants. In comparison, I was average. My height was average for a nine-year-old, and my face was reasonably well-formed, but I was more of a supporting character than the protagonist of a drama. This is not to say I was ugly, it's just that Yulong looked like he would grow up to be incredibly handsome.

"Kou, fetch a change of clothes from my room."

"Understood."

Yulong, having just received instruction from his martial arts teacher, was covered in sweat and intended to take a bath. Yulong tossed the room key to me. It wasn't so much that he trusted me, his important belongings were in a locked chest, so simply entering the room wouldn't allow me to steal anything valuable. I went to Yulong's room, got a change of clothes, and went to the bathing area. I handed the key and clothes to Yulong.

"I'm going to take a nap after my bath, so you go pull weeds in the garden or something."

"Understood."

_Weeding again?_ I thought as I headed toward the garden. Yulong was a brat who worked his servants hard and gave them no time to rest. Oops, Yulong was older than me. Because of my memories from my past life, I couldn't help but think of Yulong as a younger child. 

Yulong's goal was to become a Taoist. To do that, he had to enter a Martial Sect, which was a gathering of Taoists. The Taoists of the Martial Sects trained based on doctrines similar to Taoism. 

The first stage toward immortality was called the Qi Refining Stage, divided into fifteen levels. To pass the sect’s entrance exam, one had to reach at least the third level. Yulong was still at the second, and trained desperately.

I began waking up early in the morning to practice the Twilight Flash Swordsmanship. In addition, I also began practicing the Shaolin Kung Fu forms I had learned in my past life. 

What I felt was that my body couldn't move as I imagined it should. My body in my past life could have done it, but my current body as Kou would not cooperate. I realized I needed to repeat the movements over and over to engrave them into my body.

After about three months of such a life, a cold winter arrived, and the new year dawned. One day, I was summoned by Yulong and went to his room.

"Is there something you need?"

"You can read and write, can't you? Help me with some research."

"What are we researching?"

It seemed Yulong had been given homework by the teacher who was teaching him the basics of the immortal arts. The assignment was to translate a text written in special characters used by Taoists, and he wanted me to help with the translation. I was astonished when I saw the paper with the assignment written on it. What was written there was the Bonji that had been used as the mysterious characters in the Twilight Flash Swordsmanship secret manual.

"Master Yulong, what are these characters?"

"A commoner like you wouldn't know, but these are 'Immortal Secret Characters'. You're to look them up using this dictionary."

I was handed a thick dictionary. It was about four centimeters thick, and inside were densely packed Immortal Secret Characters and what appeared to be their explanations. Seeing this, I grew excited, thinking that if I used this to look up the Immortal Secret Characters in the secret manual, it could serve as a substitute for the oral traditions.

"What's with the strange look on your face? That dictionary is worth a hundred gold coins, you know. Don't you dare get it dirty."

"Understood."

I looked up each of the Immortal Secret Characters written on the homework paper, wrote them down on another piece of paper, and handed it to Yulong. The work took until evening, and by the time I was finished, I was exhausted. But I had also made a huge gain. With my perfect instantaneous recall, I had memorized the entire dictionary of Immortal Secret Characters. After eating, I returned to my room and used the memorized dictionary to decipher the secret manual. At last, I understood the Twilight and Dawn Art qi cultivation method and the Flash Step of the Twilight Flash Swordsmanship.

From the next morning, I began practicing the Twilight and Dawn Art and the full Twilight Flash Swordsmanship. The unfortunate part was that for my Twilight Flash Swordsmanship practice, I was using a wooden stick about sixty centimeters long. I really wanted to practice with a real sword. The desire for a real sword was genuine, and I had even considered buying one with the silver coins I received as a reward from the Prefectural Magistrate.

But I had a feeling it would be trouble if it was discovered that a servant at a textile wholesaler owned a real sword. So, I continued to practice the Twilight Flash Swordsmanship with a wooden stick as always. However, compared to when I started, I think my movements have become quite polished. I can now move about sixty percent as I imagine.

On the other hand, my qi cultivation with Twilight and Dawn Art was not showing results. Twilight and Dawn Art was a type of what is called a 'moving qigong', where one nurtures qi while moving the body slowly. This was apparently called 'refining qi'. The movements were similar to the slow movements of Tai Chi.

"What exactly is qi?"

Since I had never felt it before, I didn't know what qi was. But as I continued for a month, then two, I began to feel a heat inside my body. The first time I felt it, I jumped for joy. From then on, I could feel the qi reliably, and this seemed to be the first level of the Qi Refining Stage. I continued with Twilight and Dawn Art after that, and eventually, I became able to manipulate the qi and circulate it within my body.

"This means I've cleared the second level of the Qi Refining Stage. Why am I progressing so fast?"

Yulong has been cultivating his qi for about two years, but he's still at the same second level of the Qi Refining Stage as I am. Compared to him, my progress seems rapid. Is it a difference in talent? I don't think I have any special talent, but perhaps the Twilight and Dawn Art is a superior technique. However, the Twilight and Dawn Art in the secret manual only describes the cultivation method up to the fifth level. After that, I would have to find another method.

I continued with Twilight and Dawn Art and advanced my qi level to the third level. At the third level, you can channel the qi in your body into your muscles to strengthen a portion of your muscular power. 

It seems you can produce about twice your normal strength. Thanks to this, my movements in the Twilight Flash Swordsmanship became on par with an adult's. I think I could now defeat the average bandit. That is if my weapon was a real sword with a wooden stick it would still be difficult.
